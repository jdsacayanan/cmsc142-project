# 0/1 Knapsack Problem

The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items, each with a given weight and value, to maximize the total value without exceeding a specified weight limit.

## Problem Statement

Given:

- A set of `n` items, each with:
  - A weight `w[i]`
  - A profit `p[i]`
- A maximum weight capacity `m`

Find the subset of items that maximizes the total value while ensuring the total weight does not exceed `m`.
